                        Cat Fact: cats dont always nap
    
                        Here’s an interesting cat fact: Cats like to nap rather than sleep but if they are relaxed enough to enter a deeper sleep, they produce the same brain wave patterns that we do when we dream.

                        Cat Fact: cats communicate via nose
                        Here’s something you may not know about cats: Nose-to-nose greetings between cats are unusual, as it puts both in a vulnerable position. However, cats who know each other well but have been apart for a while feel safe enough to do this to confirm visual recognition and gain information about how the other cat is, where he has been, and what he has been doing.

                        Something You Should Know: Cats Clean Their Teeth with Meat.
                        Here’s an interesting fact about cats: Giving your cat a strip of raw meat everyday to chew on will keep his gums and teeth in good condition. Suitable meats include poultry, rabbit, or beef that has been deboned.
